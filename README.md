# E-Commerce Transaction Data Engineering Lab

This project demonstrates the end-to-end data engineering workflow on a synthetic e-commerce dataset. It covers data ingestion, profiling, cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, and serialization using Python and pandas. The goal is to apply OOP design and functional decomposition to create a clean pipeline.
